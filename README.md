### D Evangelista
Latex class for USNA Weapons, Robotics, and Control Engineering Dept capstone (senior project) report. It is based on the EW402 and EW404 report template Word document. 

## How to get this package
Clone the repository into your `texmf` tree. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devangel77b/wrcecapstone
```
On Ubuntu machines, your `texmf` is typically within your home directory (usually `/home/username/texmf`). The files should probably go within `~/texmf/tex/latex` somehwere). 

On Windows machines using Miktex I usually put the files in a `texmf` tree under `This PC > Documents` for example. 

## Examples
See the examples using `\documentclass{wrcecapstone}`, which is derived from `\documentclass{article}`.
